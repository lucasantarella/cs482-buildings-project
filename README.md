# cs482-buildings-project
Provided in this repo is a dockerfile for creating and running an environment for this,
a tutorial like notebook for you to see the creation and testing of a pipeline to try and detect buildings,
the dataset we trained and tested on,
as well as the scripts we used in addition to the notebook.

When running this project, it may be nessecary to change around path names in many places so it is something you should keep note of. 

Here is the google drive link for our prototyping step in colab if you want to look at that as well as the dataset that we used of buildings in Paris.
